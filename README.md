# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. To do so, we added a current weather description to the data that is displayed to the user. 
Additionally, prompts were created to ensure that the user can see which locations match their weather preferences. This pulled relevant travel destinations with the corresponding hotel for the user to peruse. 
Lastly, code was added to help the user create an itinerary for their selected weather preferences and location. The Google Maps API was then used to map a travel route for multiple destinations.
